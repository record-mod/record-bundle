# ReCord - Discord, re-imagined.

## What is ReCord?

ReCord is a work-in-progress Discord mod, inspired by mods such as Bunny and Revenge, aimed at being lightweight and user friendly.

## Installation

Right now, since it's unfinished, there are no installation steps yet, I will add them after it becomes stable.
